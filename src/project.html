        1. Through this project we will work with initiatives of migrant women, which promote empowerment and active
        citizenship with a particular focus on gender-based violence. Our team consists of two migrant women
        communities, Angelou Centre (UK) and UWAH (GR), the University of Newcastle and a team of developers and
        researchers from Sociality (GR).
        <p>
            2. The first two communities work with and are mostly migrant women, as far as
            beneficiaries and staff is concerned, and will be the basis for our <strong>comparative research
                project</strong>. University
            of
            Newcastle has years of experience in designing technological infrastructures for and with communities with
            intricate needs. Sociality, a cooperative from Athens Greece, has research experience and has co-developed
            and
            co-designed software with various grassroots initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. All these groups will work closely in order to develop and prototype activities that unpick the
            sensitivities of
            technology use and data management in such complex contexts.
        </p>

            4. More specifically we want to explore and
            provoke
            activities that revolve around:
            <li>notions of positive digital security, i.e freedom to act while being secure,</li>
            <li>security as socio-technical process, i.e. how people relate to security and not only how security is
                enforced upon them by designers and practitioners,</li>
            <li>delegation of access i.e through sharing resources and</li>
            <li>the use of disruptive technologies, such as blockchain.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            5. We seek to experiment and combine methodological tools and design approaches in order to develop an
            empathetic understanding of participants, their constraints, problem-solving perspectives, interrelations
            and practices. We are also informed by feminist and intersectional approaches to data management that
            provide a proper lens through which we will be enabled to zoom out and incorporate aspects of participantâ€™s
            everyday activities that are otherwise ignored or miss-treated.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. The project team will work towards the development of an open-source application that will encompass the
            aforementioned principles providing an infrastructure in order to foster tasks of these communities which
            can be held online. It will also fend for the expansion of their work to communities beyond their physical
            reach and make use of resources for educational and communication reasons that are to some degree left
            latent.
        </p>
        <p>
            7. Departing from our work with specific groups, we aim at <strong>(open source) transferability and
                scalability</strong> to
            broader contexts so as to ensure viability beyond the scope of this funding. This project is a continuation
            of our work in infrastructuring for communities and a step towards further research on the implications of
            technological design for sensitive data.
