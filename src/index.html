This is the website for the DeSIC project.

Designing Security Infrastructures for Communities with Sensitive Data (DeSIC) is a project funded from the NOT EQUAL network.

In the following months Newcastle University with Angelou Centre, the Union of Women Associations of Herakleion (UWAH) and Sociality Cooperative will collaborate in order to design, evaluate and implement a low fidelity prototype for a secure and private application that communities which deal with sensitive data can use in their daily workflow.
