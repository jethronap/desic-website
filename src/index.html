  <p>This is the website for the DeSIC project.</p>
  <p>Designing Security Infrastructures for Communities with Sensitive Data (DeSIC) is a project funded from the NOT EQUAL network.</p>
  <p>In the following months Newcastle University with Angelou Centre, the Union of Women Associations of Herakleion (UWAH) and Sociality Cooperative will collaborate in order to design, evaluate and implement a low fidelity prototype for a secure and private application that communities which deal with sensitive data can use in their daily workflow.</p>
