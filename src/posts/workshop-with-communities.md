After having completed the first iteration of communication and research with our partners, we decided to create and deploy some scenarios that would help us better understand the implications of several themes to the design of secure systems.

The themes that came to the foreground after the first iteration were the following:

* Data Collection & Classification
* Safeguarding of Data & Sharing
* Data Communication

You can check out the scenarios we deployed in the workshops in the following Miro Board, [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lBBa_Lw=/).
