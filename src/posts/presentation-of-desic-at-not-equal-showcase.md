The DeSIC research team presented the project to the Not-Equal Showcase.

It was a very interesting day with a lot of exciting projects funded from the Not-Equal Network.
You can find the projects [here](https://not-equal.tech/not-equal-funds-seven-new-projects-to-tackle-critical-issues-around-technology-and-social-justice/) 

Erinma Ochu, Senior Lecturer, Digital Media & Communications at The Manchester Metropolitan University and Senior Research Fellow, Engaging Environments at the University of Reading was the keynote speaker.

Her speech _Building Equity, Social Justice and Co-Enquiry Processes into Digital Technology_ was more than inspiring.

DeSIC wants to thank all attendees, presenters and the Not-Equal Network for having us there.
